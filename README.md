# subatoScraper
This scraper was made with the intention of learning a bit about bash.

The script loops over a given range of urls and checks if that url represents a valid exercise sheet, in which case it grabs the module name, exercise name and number and echoes them on the terminal.

No harm intended. 

# Planned Features
* Improve speed -> why does each curl take so long?
* Threaded gets might help further improve speed
* When given a path as argument, create the folder structure and download .zip files of each exercise (with further param to directly unzip, which might take longer)



No hamsters were injured during the production of this script.
