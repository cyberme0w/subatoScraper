# subatoScraper
This scraper was made with the intention of learning a bit about bash.

The script loops over a given range of urls and checks if that url represents a valid exercise sheet, in which case it grabs the module name, exercise name and number and echoes them on the terminal.

No harm intended. 
No hamsters were injured during the production of this script.
